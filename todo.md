To-Do:

7/8/2024
    Major issues (priority on top of list):
        <!-- - Make the gold, silver, bronze brackets be a button on the schedule page of that tournament, along with a schedule button and pool play button
        (each tournament needs a schedule, pool play, bronze, silver, gold page) -->
            <!-- - Make sure it goes to the correct bracket for bronze, silver, or gold bracket selected from the buttons on bottom left of the page -->
        <!-- - Figure out initializing brackets (the matches specifically with the sides and contestantId stuff) -->
        - Make the bracketform stuff all take in the current data of the current bracket and match it accordingly
            - Also, have the stuff that should be kept the same (like data that was already there) be filled out automatically on the bracketform
        - Then, make the number of rounds (and other components) be revisable on each of the different bracket pages for bronze, silver, and gold pages
        - The brackets then need location, time, etc. all figured out
            - It would be nice if I could somehow just pass on the location and time as objects of each match and set them up on the schedule based on how I want them to be
            (do I want it to be organized based on time or what?) 

    Minor issues (priority on top of list):
        - addTournament keeps reloading all the tournaments back up with that newly added tournament



Final step:
    - Styling
